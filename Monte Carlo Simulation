6.1 [2 pt] You receive one of five distinct coupons uniformily at random each day. Use the Monte Carlo Method to estimate to within .01 days, 
the expected number of days until you collect two copies of each of the five coupons. Record your answer in ANS61.


import numpy as np

res = []

for i in range(10000):
    coupon_dict = {1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0}
    days = 0
    while coupon_dict[1] < 2 or coupon_dict[2] < 2 or coupon_dict[3] < 2 or coupon_dict[4] < 2 or coupon_dict[5] < 2:
        coupon_num = np.random.randint(1,6)
        coupon_dict[coupon_num] += 1
        days+=1
    res.append(days)

ANS61 = np.round(np.average(res),1)
